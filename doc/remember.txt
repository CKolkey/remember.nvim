This is a Neovim version of the Vim plugin vim-lastplace. It uses the same
logic as vim-lastplace but also as much as possible the Neovim Lua API.

It's called remember because it remembers where you were last before exiting a
file.

When opening a file the plugin will set the cursor position to the edit
position instead of top of the file. It ignores commit messages and certain
buffer types.
